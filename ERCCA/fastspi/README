MoteClockC and TelosSerialP are replacements for stuff in the
.platform directory.

Msp430ClockC, Msp430ClockP, and Msp430DcoSpec.h are replacements
for what's in chips/msp430/timer.

You should put all this someplace that gets included before the
default code.

Build-time #defines:

  ENABLE_SPI0_DMA -- if defined, run the CPU at 4 MHz and use
                     DMA for SPI; otherwise, run the CPU at
                     8 MHz and do software SPI. This requires
                     the latest TinyOS chips/msp430/usart code,
                     but the clock setting here works regardless.

                     Used in Msp430DcoSpec.h. This file can define
                     MHZ_8 which is used in Msp430ClockP.nc

  HAVE_ROSC_P2_5  -- if defined, use the external ROSC resistor
                     on P2.5; otherwise, use the internal DCO
                     resistor.

                     Used in Msp430ClockP.nc

  FAST_SMCLK      -- if defined, run the peripherals at 4 MHz;
                     otherwise, run the peripherals at 1 MHz,
                     the TinyOS default. These rates are indep-
                     endent of the the ENABLE_SPI0_DMA setting.

                     Used in Msp430ClockP.nc and TelosSerialP.nc
